# Problem statement

Schuster is a multinational retail company dealing in sports goods and accessories. Schuster conducts significant business with hundreds of its vendors, with whom it has credit arrangements. Unfortunately, not all vendors respect credit terms and some of them tend to make payments late.
Schuster would like to better understand the customersâ€™ payment behaviour based on their past payment patterns (customer segmentation).
Using historical information, it wants to be able to predict the likelihood of delayed payment against open invoices from its customers
It wants to use this information so that collectors can prioritise their work in following up with customers beforehand to get the payments on time.
